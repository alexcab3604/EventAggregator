Questionnaire
Design
1.	A Prompt is an abstract class, it has:
a.	Title
b.	Description
c.	
2.	A Prompt can be simple/leave or composite.
3.	A leave Prompt is a basic element that can be part of a composite Prompt, some samples are:
a.	InformationalText 
b.	Note
c.	ErrorMessage
d.	Answer types:
i.	BooleanAnswer
ii.	TextAnswer
iii.	CurrencyAnswer
iv.	DateAnswer
v.	NumericAnswer
vi.	PhoneAnswer
vii.	EmailAnswer
viii.	UrlAnswer
ix.	See HTML5 input types for other types of answers
4.	A composite Prompt is composed by basic Prompts, some examples are:
a.	Question, abstract class:
i.	SingleAnswerQuestion
ii.	MultipleAnswerQuestion
b.	Questionnaire
c.	QuantityPerDurationAnswer
i.	TextAnswer
ii.	List of BooleanAnswer options (durations) to select one
Notes:
1.	A basic/leave element doesn’t depend of any other element.
2.	A composite element is composed by other elements that can be leaves and/or other composites.
Prompt Properties
1.	Each prompt has a Parent that is the prompt that contains it.
2.	The Questionnaire is the only prompt whose Parent property is null.
Objects Dependencies
1.	There can be forward dependencies among the prompts
2.	No backward dependencies are allowed
3.	No cyclic dependencies are allowed
4.	Cascade dependencies are possible
a.	A change in “A” can trigger an update in “B” and so on, see an example below.
b.	A -> B -> C -> D
5.	Dependency types between prompts: 
a.	Active
i.	Target prompts will be active only if source prompt is active
b.	Disable
c.	Required
i.	The value of certain properties of other prompts depend if the source Answer prompt was  answered.
d.	SpecificValue (other prompts will react if a given prompt has an specific value; i.e. a BooleanAnswer is true)
e.	Valid (other prompts will react if a prompt has any given valid value)
Event Types
1.	OnActive
a.	Notified by a prompt when its “IsActive property changed to true
2.	OnInActive
a.	Notified by a prompt when its “IsActive property changed to false
3.	OnEnable
a.	Notified by a prompt when its “IsEnabled property changed to true
4.	OnDisable
a.	Notified by a prompt when its “IsEnabled property changed to false
5.	OnValueChanged
a.	Notified by a prompt when its “Value” property changed 
6.	OnAnswered
a.	Notified by a prompt when any valid or invalid answer was enter into its Value
b.	This might be used for the Required dependency
7.	OnUnswered
a.	Notified by a prompt when its Value property does not contain any value. This might happen during setup if the prompt has not default value, or if the answer was deleted
b.	This might be used for the Required dependency
Business/Validation Rules
1.	Extract business/validation rules outside of the prompts.
2.	Each prompt has an IsValid property and a “Rules” collection attached. This promotes reusability of each “Rule” object and rule objects can be attached/detached to/from a prompt at runtime depending of certain conditions if needed.
3.	The “IsValid” property iterates the “Rules” collection and returns “true” if all the rules are true, or “false” otherwise
